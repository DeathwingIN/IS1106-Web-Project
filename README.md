# Welcome to my first project repository!

This project was created for my 1st semester project in the subject of Foundation Web Technologies. It is a basic web page that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks.

This project marks my initial steps into web development, and I am proud of my achievements in creating this project from scratch. It has been a great learning experience for me, and I hope that this project will help others who are just starting out in web development.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest any improvements that you think would make it better. Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository!
